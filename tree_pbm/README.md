### The One-Site Tree Cutting Problem

We would like to formalize the tree cutting problem and compute the strategy which maximizes the revenue.
A tree keeps growing over time with a rate which may depend on the weather and it stops when it reaches
a certain maximum height. At the same time the tree may get a disease, in which case it dies and looses all
its value. When the company decides to cut a tree, it gains an amount of money which is proportional to
the height of the tree. Whenever a tree is cut (or it is dead), a new tree has to be planted with a fixed cost.
Knowing that the one unit of money looses value over time, find the optimal cutting strategy.
